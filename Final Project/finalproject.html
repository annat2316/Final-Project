    <img class="Ann2" src="Ann 2.jpg" alt="Ann">
<p>Ann Tsukamoto is best known for her stem cell research. She was an undergraduate 
at UC San Diego and obtained her PHD at UCLA. She did postdoctoral research at UCSF. 
She has had many leadership roles overseeing isolation and application of human 
neural and liver stem cells to various diseases. She is currently part of the group
StemCells, Inc. She joined in 1998 as first of a world-class team of researchers focused
on the discovery and development of major human stem cells.According to the U.S. National 
Institute of Health, Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish them 
from other types of cells. First, they are unspecialized cells that renew themselves for 
long periods through cell division. The second is that under certain physiologic or 
experimental conditions, they can be induced to become cells with special functions 
such as the beating cells of the heart muscle or the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas.
Scientists primarily work with embryonic and adult stem cells.</p>

         <p>Ann Tsukamoto is the co-patentee of a process to isolate human
         stem-cells. Her work has led to advancements in Cancer research, and may
         one day lead to a cure. She is part of a world-class team of researchers 
         focused on the discovery and development of major human stem-cells.
         She is currently directing further research in stem-cell growth and cellular biology.</p>
